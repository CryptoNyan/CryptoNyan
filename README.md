## About CryptoNyan
~~There's not much to say, but I will expand this once I have new info to share~~

### About me personally
I'm a newbie programmer, currently learning c# at school, and Frontend Web Development at home.

My goal is to get a nice IT job and personally create some good open-source software to make people's lives a little better :D

### My programming skills
| Language | Skill Level |
| --- | --- |
|C# | Beginner |
|JavaScript | Very Basic |

Yep, that's about it. But hey, I still got a lot of years to learn new things. For now I am trying out a few languages to see what I like. My next goal is checking out Rust, but for now I intend to focus on improving what I am currently learning, instead of trying out too much at once.

**Learning timeline**
* Q1 2021 - Q2 2023 (estimated end)
  * Learning C# at school
* Q2 2021 - Q3 2021
  * Learned Unity basics
* Q1 2022 - Unkown
  * Learning frontend web dev through FrontendMasters

### Contacting me
If for whatever reason you need to contact me, send me a Twitter dm. I don't check that account often though, as I have no clue why anyone would want to message me, so please be patient.
