## About CryptoNyan

### About me personally
I'm a newbie programmer, currently learning c# at school, and Frontend Web Development at home.

My goal is to get a nice IT job and personally create some good FOSS to make people's lives a little better :D

### My programming skills
Language | Skill Level
--- | ---
C# | Basic
JavaScript | Beginner

### Other development related skills
Skill | Skill Level

HTML  | Basic
CSS | Basic
Unity Game Engine | Basic

Yep, that's about it. But hey, I still got a lot of years to learn new things. For now I am trying out a few languages to see what I like. My next goal is checking out Rust, but for now I intend to focus on improving what I am currently learning, instead of trying out too much at once.

**Learning timeline**
* Q1 2021 - Q1 2022
  * Learned C# at school
* Q2 2021 - Q3 2021
  * Learned Unity basics
* Q1 2022 - Unkown
  * Learning frontend web dev through FrontendMasters

### Note about Skill Levels
Obviously these terms are very subjective, kinda vague, and leave out a lot of nuance. They simply exist as a general explanation of my own confidence in my abilities. For more details, feel free to contact me.
Anyways, here's a general explanation of the currently used terms, as I see them:

* Beginner
  * I am not particularly confident in my abilities, can however get things done if required, although it may take time
* Basic
  * I know my way around this language and can get stuff done, although I probably don't know how to do any fancier stuff, and still have quite some room to learn

(More coming once I get better)

### Contacting me
If for whatever reason you need to contact me, send me a Twitter dm. I don't check that account often though, so please be patient. I don't tend to use twitter, it's just a nice contact option.
