### About me personally
I'm a newbie programmer, currently learning c# at school, with some motivation issues. My progress is slow, but steady enough.


I likely won't be an amazing well-known programmer in the future, but my goal is to get a nice IT job and personally create some good open-source software to make people's lives a little better :D

### My programming skills
| Language | Skill Level |
| --- | --- |
|C# | Beginner |

Yep, that's about it. But hey, I still got a lot of years to learn new things. After I get to at least intermediate c#, I intend to check out c++, possibly javascript, and maybe even Rust. Things never go as planned though, so I'm planning on those plans to not go according to plan.

**Learning timeline**
* Q1 2021 - Q2 2023 (estimated end)
  * Learning C# at school
* Q2 2021 - Q3 2021
  * Learned Unity basics

### Contacting me
If for whatever reason you need to contact me, send me a Twitter dm. I don't check that account often though, as I have no clue why anyone would want to message me, so please be patient.
